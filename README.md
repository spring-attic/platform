## Spring IO Platform

Spring IO brings together the core Spring APIs into a cohesive and versioned foundational Platform
for modern applications. On top of this foundation it also provides domain-specific runtimes (DSRs)
optimized for specific application types. Please see the [Spring IO Platform website] for more
information.

## Using the Platform

How you use the platform depends on whether you're using Maven or Gradle to build your application.

### Using the Platform with Maven

The Platform provides a pom file that you can either import into your application's pom, or use as
your application's parent pom. Please refer to the [documentation on using the Platform with Maven]
[Platform Maven docs] for more information.

### Using the Platform With Gradle

Thanks to the [dependency management plugin][], Gradle users can also make use of the Platform's
pom. Please refer to the [documentation on using the Platform with Gradle][Platform Gradle docs] for
more information.
