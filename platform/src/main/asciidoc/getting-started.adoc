[[getting-started-introducing-spring-io-platform]]
== Introducing Spring IO Platform
Spring IO Platform brings together the core Spring APIs into a cohesive platform for modern
applications. It provides versions of numerous projects in the Spring portfolio along with their
dependencies that are tested and known to work together.

[[getting-started-using-spring-io-platform]]
== Using Spring IO Platform
Spring IO Platform is primarily intended to be used with a dependency management system. It works
well with both Maven and Gradle.

[[getting-started-using-spring-io-platform-maven]]
=== Using Spring IO Platform with Maven
The Platform uses Maven's support for {maven-dependency-management}[dependency management] to
provide dependency versions to your application's build. To consume this dependency management you
can import the Platform's bom into your application's pom:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
			 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
			 xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

		<modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

		<groupId>com.example</groupId>
		<artifactId>your-application</artifactId>
		<version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

		<dependencyManagement>
			<dependencies>
				<dependency>
					<groupId>io.spring.platform</groupId>
					<artifactId>platform-bom</artifactId>
					<version>{platform-version}</version>
					<type>pom</type>
					<scope>import</scope>
				</dependency>
			</dependencies>
		</dependencyManagement>

		<!-- Dependency declarations -->

ifeval::["{platform-repo}" != "release"]
		<!-- Add Spring repositories -->
		<!-- (you don't need this if you are using a -RELEASE or -SR version) -->
		<repositories>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" == "snapshot"]
			<repository>
				<id>spring-snapshots</id>
				<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
				<snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
			</repository>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" == "milestone"]
			<repository>
				<id>spring-milestones</id>
				<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
			</repository>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" != "release"]
		</repositories>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" != "release"]
		<pluginRepositories>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" == "snapshot"]
			<pluginRepository>
				<id>spring-snapshots</id>
				<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
				<snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
			</pluginRepository>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" == "milestone"]
			<pluginRepository>
				<id>spring-milestones</id>
				<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
			</pluginRepository>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" != "release"]
		</pluginRepositories>
endif::[]
	</project>
----

Alternatively, rather than importing the Platform's bom, you may prefer to use it as your pom's
parent:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
			 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
			 xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

		<modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

		<groupId>com.example</groupId>
		<artifactId>your-application</artifactId>
		<version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

		<parent>
			<groupId>io.spring.platform</groupId>
			<artifactId>platform-bom</artifactId>
			<version>{platform-version}</version>
			<relativePath/>
		</parent>

		<!-- Dependency declarations -->

ifeval::["{platform-repo}" != "release"]
		<!-- Add Spring repositories -->
		<!-- (you don't need this if you are using a -RELEASE or -SR version) -->
		<repositories>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" == "snapshot"]
			<repository>
				<id>spring-snapshots</id>
				<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
				<snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
			</repository>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" == "milestone"]
			<repository>
				<id>spring-milestones</id>
				<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
			</repository>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" != "release"]
		</repositories>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" != "release"]
		<pluginRepositories>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" == "snapshot"]
			<pluginRepository>
				<id>spring-snapshots</id>
				<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
				<snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
			</pluginRepository>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" == "milestone"]
			<pluginRepository>
				<id>spring-milestones</id>
				<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
			</pluginRepository>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" != "release"]
		</pluginRepositories>
endif::[]
	</project>
----

Taking this approach, in addition to the dependency management that importing the pom provides, your
application will also gain some plugin management that provides sensible defaults for a number of
plugins, including {spring-boot-docs-maven-plugin}[Spring Boot's Maven Plugin]. To take advantage of
this default configuration, all you then need to do is to include the plugin in the `<plugins>`
section of your pom:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>
----

By using the Platform as your pom's parent, you will also be able to make use of the properties
that it declares and to override those properties. One reason for overriding a property is to
change the version of a dependency. See <<getting-started-overriding-versions-maven>> for more
information.

If you want to use the Platform and Spring Boot together, you don't have to use the Platform's pom
as the parent. Instead, you can import the Platform's pom as described above and then perform the
rest of the configuration manually. {spring-boot-docs-maven}[Spring Boot's documentation on using
it with Maven] will show you how.

Whichever approach you choose, no dependencies will be added to your application. However, when you
do declare a dependency on something that's part of the Platform, you will now be able to omit the
version number. For example:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
----

For more details of what's included in the Platform and the versions that are provided, please
refer to the <<appendix-dependency-versions, appendix>>.

[[getting-started-using-spring-io-platform-gradle]]
=== Using Spring IO Platform with Gradle
To use the Platform with Gradle, you can use the Gradle
{dependency-management-plugin}[Dependency Management Plugin] and import the bom in much the same
way as you would with Maven. The use of a plugin is necessary as Gradle does not provide an
equivalent of Maven's built-in dependency management support.

To use the plugin, you configure your build to apply the plugin and then in the
`dependencyManagement` configuration you import the Platform's bom:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
	buildscript {
		repositories {
			jcenter()
		}
		dependencies {
			classpath 'io.spring.gradle:dependency-management-plugin:{dependency-management-plugin-version}'
		}
	}

	apply plugin: 'io.spring.dependency-management'

	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" == "snapshot"]
		maven { url 'https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot' }
endif::[]
ifeval::["{platform-repo}" == "milestone"]
		maven { url 'https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone' }
endif::[]
	}

	dependencyManagement {
		imports {
			mavenBom 'io.spring.platform:platform-bom:{platform-version}'
		}
	}
----

With this configuration in place you can then declare a dependency on an artifact that's part of
the Platform without specifying a version:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
	dependencies {
		compile 'org.springframework:spring-core'
	}
----

For more details of what's included in the Platform and the versions that are provided, please
refer to the <<appendix-dependency-versions, appendix>>.

[[getting-started-overriding-versions]]
== Overriding Spring IO Platform's dependency management
One of the major benefits of the Spring IO Platform is that it provides a set of versions that are
known to work together, while also allowing you to override those versions to suit the needs of
your project.

Both the Spring IO Platform bom, and the Spring Boot bom from which it inherits, use properties to
define the versions of the managed dependencies. To change the version of a dependency the value of
its version property can be overridden. To identify the property that you wish to override, consult
the `<properties>` sections of the Spring IO Platform bom and the Spring Boot bom from which it
inherits. Exactly how the property is overridden depends on whether your project is built with
Maven or Gradle.

[[getting-started-overriding-versions-maven]]
=== Overriding a version using Maven
To override a property in Maven you must use the Platform's bom as your pom's parent. You can then
declare the property in your pom's `<properties>` section with the desired value:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
	<properties>
		<foo.version>1.1.0.RELEASE</foo.version>
	</properties>
----

[[getting-started-overriding-versions-gradle]]
=== Overriding a version using Gradle
To override a property in Gradle, configure its value in your `build.gradle` script:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
	ext['foo.version'] = '1.1.0.RELEASE'
----

Or in `gradle.properties`:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
	foo.version=1.1.0.RELEASE
----

[[getting-started-logging]]
=== Logging

Spring IO Platform builds on top of Spring Boot which takes a somewhat opinionated view about
logging in that it aims to prevent Commons Logging from being used by default. Instead, it
encourages the use of Logback via its `spring-boot-starter-logging` module. Support for other
logging frameworks, including Log4J2, is also provided. Wherever possible, applications built
using Spring IO Platform should adopt this approach.

If you choose not to use Spring Boot's `spring-boot-starter-logging` module but still wish to avoid
the use of Commons Logging, using SLF4J and its `jcl-over-slf4j` module is recommended along with
a logging backend such as Logback or Log4J2.
